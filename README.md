# Chess-Bot
A chess bot which doesn't select its next move at random. 
Uses deep iterative search methods and alpha beta pruning for min and max. 
Able to evaluate each State, return the current state of the moves that are the most desirable for the player. 

The purpose of this project was to be able to beat the other bots given to us in the project,
every bot with a more advanced technique of play.
